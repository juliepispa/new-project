    <h1>Whales</h1>
    <p>
      Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic
      placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the
      infraorder Cetacea, which usually excludes dolphins and porpoises. Whales,
      dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists
      of even-toed ungulates.
